how is react helpful than javascript



it has to understand when to rerender what...

why do we use setstate ..not directly x=5  (hint react knows when to rerender while javascript)


//

React is a rerender master

immutability




----useEffect----
control over renderre
1.first time it changes we do something..
2.any variable is changed we do something
3.anystate variable changes we renderre

.. when default value is called
..suppose if we have 5 set variable we and specific variable changes we rerender... thats 2.
.. and if any one of variable changes we rerender..thats 3.


rerender is on state and rerender ke sath kuch krna is useEffect/// 
example task: local stoarage mai store krna.. api calling krna..etc

if u want to change a element of array 
create a new array with the changed vaule and setState.
