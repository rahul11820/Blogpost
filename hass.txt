how is react helpful than javascript



it has to understand when to rerender what...

why do we use setstate ..not directly x=5  (hint react knows when to rerender while javascript)


//

React is a rerender master

immutability




----useEffect----
control over renderre
1.first time it changes we do something..
2.any variable is changed we do something
3.anystate variable changes we renderre

.. when default value is called
..suppose if we have 5 set variable we and specific variable changes we rerender... thats 2.
.. and if any one of variable changes we rerender..thats 3.


rerender is on state and rerender ke sath kuch krna is useEffect/// 
example task: local stoarage mai store krna.. api calling krna..etc

if u want to change a element of array 
create a new array with the changed vaule and setState.

Oop:
Pillars of OPPS
Abstraction: creating object without details
Inheritance: getting /inheriting the properties of the parent calss
encapsulation: keeping the data together/ wrapping up data/ hiding the data /
Polymorphisom: function name being same, variable being difference
Ojects: Instance of the blueprint/ actual data/ actual value
class:
Constructors: function to create a instance of a object based on the class
Deconstrucors: Function to delete a instance--to avoid more memory usage
Interface: we make interface to interact with class
Public ,Private, Protected
annotations:


ruby: it doesnt have implicit type conversion

why--model ..because it is agnostic;; it can be used with any api
react-route-controller-model-database-model-react


what is a class
why do we do migration
why do keep migration files
controller has to be plural
model has to singular and talbes have to create_table
files use lowecase


test= user.find(m)
test.name = fjsdkfj
test.save

whereever the many is the ones primary key
we create a 3rd table if many to many relationship


Write has_many : artivle in user.rb--model
and belongs_to : user in artivels.rb
